YouTube Earnings Calculator

Description:
Developed a web application using React that calculates potential earnings for YouTube videos based on a unique algorithm. The application accepts YouTube video share links, fetches data from the YouTube API, and presents users with an estimation of earnings. The algorithm factors in video likes, comments, views, and subscriber count to provide an insightful prediction.

Key Features:

    Accepts YouTube video share links.
    Fetches video data from the YouTube API, including title, likes, comments, views, and thumbnail.
    Utilizes a custom algorithm to estimate earnings based on user engagement and subscriber count.
    Supports saving and displaying previously calculated earnings for other videos.

Technologies Used:
React, React Router, YouTube API, Email.js, CSS, and more.

Responsibilities:

    Designed and implemented the frontend user interface using React components.
    Integrated with the YouTube API to retrieve video data dynamically.
    Implemented a custom algorithm to calculate potential earnings based on video metrics.
    Enabled user interaction with pop-up forms for requesting a callback.

Outcome:
The application provides users with insights into the earning potential of YouTube videos, encouraging content creators to assess the financial impact of their content. The use of React and external APIs enhances the project's scalability and interactivity.

Note: This project showcases my proficiency in React, API integration, algorithmic thinking, and user interface design. The combination of frontend development and data processing demonstrates a comprehensive skill set in web development.









# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
